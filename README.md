# Rucoy Map Parser

A graphical program showcasing how to parse the old pre-1.10 Rucoy map files found in the ``assets/maps`` folder.

# How to use

Go to the ``releases`` page of this repo and download the ``.exe`` or compile the project yourself.

Then download a Rucoy version that is version 1.10 or older; a copy of [Rucoy Online 1.10](https://www.mediafire.com/file/gen23mk92fww8yu/rucoy-online-1.10.0.apk/file) can be found here.
Use a website like https://www.ezyzip.com/extract-apk-files.html to unpack the APK.
Find the ``ground.png`` file and drop it in the folder with the ``.exe``

Good luck!

# Why not include ground.png?

https://www.oryxdesignlab.com/ might sue me. ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
