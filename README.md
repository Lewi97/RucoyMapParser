# Rucoy Map Parser

A graphical program showcasing how to parse the old pre-1.10 Rucoy map files found in the ``assets/maps`` folder.

# How to use

Go to the ``releases`` page of this repo and download the ``.exe`` or compile the project yourself.

Then download a Rucoy version that is version 1.10 or older; a copy of (Rucoy Online 1.10)[https://www.mediafire.com/file/gen23mk92fww8yu/rucoy-online-1.10.0.apk/file] can be found here.
Use a website like (https://www.ezyzip.com/extract-apk-files.html)[https://www.ezyzip.com/extract-apk-files.html] to unpack the APK.
Download the Zip from the website and copy the ``assets/maps`` folder and put it in a folder in the same directory as the ``.exe``.
Do the same for the ``ground.png``

Good luck!
